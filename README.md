#forkbomb

Looking after Github forks can be a PitA. It's very easy to miss important upstream changes, and who has time to check this stuff?

Well, Forkbomb does. Enable Forkbomb for your forks, and every so often it will open a PR from the upstream project into your clone. The choice of whether to merge is yours, but Forkbomb will make sure you have that choice.

This is early, early pre-alpha stuff, it almost certainly has bugs, but it can't write to your repos, so please feel free to give it a go. We're looking for feedback [here](https://github.com/theodi/forkbomb/issues).
